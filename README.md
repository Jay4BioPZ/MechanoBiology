# Deformation cytometry data analysis

## Basic Information

The code is applied for [Mechanobiology 2023](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/mechanobiology-how-mechanics-regulate-life-ME-480) course project. The goal is to implement the analytical part of the deformation cytometry (DC). Together with Clarisse Jeanne Maylis Pierre, Antoine Edouard Chekireb-Pack, Nadim Daher, and Michel Chammas, we successfully constructed a processing pipeline for the DC data. We extracted and discussed changes in mechanical features of cell lines in response to ME480 protein expression (a presumably-cell-mechanics-related protein). Specifically, I was responsible for image stack preprocessing and segmentation.
